title: Teaching with 11ty
---

As if the popularity of 11ty in a certain class of developers was not high enough, I learned today that Google are also in the 11ty business. Their new course on learning the basics of CSS, creatively named [Learn CSS][lcss], is written in 11ty.

In fact it turns out that the whole [web.dev][wd] web site is one big 11ty site. You can find the source code  on the [web.dev GitHub repository][wdgh].

Who knew that 11ty had friends in high places? It’s certainly testament to its flexibility that it can be used to build such a large and diverse site.
