title: "Form Formation: Bootstrap Form"
---

Upon reading some of my posts about form formation in Ruby a colleague pointed out the [Bootstrap Form][bf] Ruby gem.

This gem is firmly in the camp of HTML generation. It is follows the conventional Rails approach of defining a custom form builder, inheriting from the in-built default. I examined the writing of a custom form builder in [Rails ViewComponents][rvc] after an initial look in [Rails Form Builder][rfb].

What Bootstrap Form does is provide out-of-the-box Bootstrap markup for forms. By using the method `bootstrap_form_for` instead of the default `form_for` and simply using a one-line statement per field it produces the fully fledged Bootstrap markup including label, form control and error messages.

```
<%= bootstrap_form_for(@user) do |f| %>
  <%= f.email_field :email %>
  <%= f.password_field :password %>
  <%= f.check_box :remember_me %>
  <%= f.submit "Log In" %>
<% end %>
```

This looks remarkably like the [dynamic Phoenix forms][dpf]. It is concise, and it is a clear mapping between attribute and form control. It is technically imperative, but carries a declarative feel. The form builder takes all of the responsibilities for generating the field, almost acting like the widget in the more declarative approaches of [Django][dj] and [Bureaucrat][bu]. The main distinction is that here the mapping is happening in the template itself.

This opens up another axis of enquiry. Given HTML forms can be so complex (see [persisting drafts][pd]) and that many of the conventions live in some particular configuration of the HTML, there is a great benefit in unifying this and componentizing it. In this case the componentization of Bootstrap markup is happening in the custom form builder, nicely abstracted away from view.
